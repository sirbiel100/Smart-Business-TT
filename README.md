## Strategy

- My strategy for this challenge was first divide the objective in parts, and that's how I decided to do it:

1. Make the UI first (Choose the colors, the table design, searching field, mobile-first)

2. Fetch the data:
    - Since I am not familiar with redux yet I decided first to fetch the data through the usual way, fetch API.
    - Then I decided to deal with typescript problems, such as the "ID" field just accept numbers (or undefined).

3. Implement Redux:
    - I saw some redux practices and I tried to not get too much deep into redux yet otherwise I would lose too much time on it, so I did the basic.

## Challenges

- As mentioned above I had difficult to understand redux. But after I search for some videos on youtube to understand better I could finally comprehend how it works and its importance for bigger and complex apps.
